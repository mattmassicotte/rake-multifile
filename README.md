# rake-multi-file

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mattmassicotte/rake-multifile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mattmassicotte/rake-multifile)

Really simple gem that adds a new type of task to Rake. It is a combination of multitask and file: a file task that performs all of its dependencies in parallel automatically.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
